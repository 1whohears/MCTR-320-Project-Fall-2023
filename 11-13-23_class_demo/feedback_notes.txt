It is now known that at least one obsticle will be in the middle.

Robot will start in bottom right and the goal is top left.

Suggested to create an internal map that keeps track of obsticles and current position.

Need to do a sweep more often. 

Being fast is pointless if you drive into walls. Speed is secondary priority.

Remember that ultra sonic distance sensors are inaccurate when pointing at non tangent surfaces.

Probably need to have a drive and update map/sweep tasks run asynchronously.
